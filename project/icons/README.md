# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons:
- icon16.png (16x16px)
- icon48.png (48x48px) 
- icon128.png (128x128px)

You can create these icons using any design tool or generate them from the Lucide layers icon used in the extension.

For now, the extension will work without icons, but adding them will make it look more professional in the Chrome Web Store and browser toolbar.
